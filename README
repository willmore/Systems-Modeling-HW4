Homework 4

FileSystem
Fujaba: FileSystem.cr

SummarizeFileSizeVisitor prints the name of directories and regular files, and the size of regular files.

See SingletonRoot.java for requested methods that utilize visitors and singleton Root. 

For the bonus point, we added an optional ExtensionFilter to CounterVisitor.

We were a bit confused on the requirement to implement a combination of findAll(extension) and countFiles()
to create a method to count all java files. We assumed that our ExtensionFilter implementation satisfies this requirement.
Please see this working by running CounterVisitTest and entering "java" when prompted for the extension.

For interactive tests demonstrating visitors (and bonus) please execute:
SearchVisitorTest.java
SummarizeFileSizeVisitorTest.java
CounterVisitTest.java

MauMau
Fujaba: MauMau.ctr

Case 1: Dealer deals 2 cards to everyone.
Case 2: Playing a 7 to force next player to draw a card.
Case 3: Playing a Jack and selecting a new suit. We implemented choosing a suit and playing the Jack as two discrete steps.
Case 4: Playing an 8 to forcing next player to draw.
Case 5: Playing a normal card.

For unit tests execute MauMauAllTests.java.

Note: We did not implement many error checks, as the scenarios did not require them. 
For example, checking that the suit or number of a card placed on the open deck is not enforced.
